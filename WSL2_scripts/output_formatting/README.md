## nf-core/pacvar Excel report generator (prototype)

This folder contains an early version of the Python script for formatting `nf-core/pacvar` outputs.

It was developed and tested locally in WSL2 to iteratively implement new features, adjust the script, and inspect outputs. This process led to the first working version of the script.

### Files
- `generate_puretarget_xlsx_report.py` – main Python script for generating formatted Excel reports
- `run_puretarget_xlsx_report.sh` – shell wrapper to run the script locally
